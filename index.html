        <p><h1>Week 2</h1><br>
            Forming and norming. We came together as a group of four, with the addition of a fifth member shortly after. Some members of the group I have worked with before and others I haven’t, so norming had to take place. We aren’t aware of the strengths and weaknesses within the team yet but were able to assign tasks quickly.

        <p><h1>Week 3</h1><br>
            The session on Github management was useful and team strengthening. Between Software Engineering and Linux I’ve found enjoyment in the command line, I’m trying to use it where possible. I know I can move documents in the cloned repo with a mouse click, I chose to move them with the command line instead. A strong handle on the Github platform makes life easier. 
            Some storming occurred between another teammate and I. It was embarrassing to have happen in front of other teams, I now know I need to be more understanding of my teammates. To be motivated to work together in a team there needs to be a level of professionalism and acceptance of ideas, I took this on board.
            The website pages are working nicely together, and we have it hosted up on Github pages. Github pages took some figuring out, but a teammate and I managed to get it working. Jekyll is another story, but for now the website works and most user stories have been fulfilled.

        <p><h1>Week 4</h1><br>
Scrums are a sticking point for the team. I myself have 2 days during the week without classes, so I’m only able to be present for 3 scrums a week (if they happen). A scrum schedule was made up during the second week but it has been difficult to adhere to. Most scrums happen for us in the classroom.
I reviewed a teammates web page and moved it to the reviewer approved column. My task for the sprint has also been moved to this column, it’s reassuring  to know that a teammate has seen it and is happy with my work.
Speaking with the client this week let us know that we are on the right track. I was worried about the look of our website, but that is a matter for a future sprint goal. We have working software which is more important. 
Agile development makes me see the importance in the little things. Many small steps can lead to a great piece of software. Each step of development is deliberate, but not permanent.

        <p><h1>Week 5</h1>
            Sprint 2 planning and task assigning on Tuesday. We successfully closed 4 out of 5 of our issues from the previous Sprint, with one issues rolling over to the second Sprint. 
During reflection I realized that I had not been attending as many Scrums as I should be, and we weren’t enforcing them well enough as a team. I attended all Scrums possible for the rest of the week.
Git Branches were introduced. I asked many questions so I could be completely clear on how  they work and why we need them. I created my own branch for my Sprint 2 issue but have not yet pushed to the master branch. I would like to discuss with my team before this happens.
I’m having a difficult time incorporating Javascript in to the html, it has been a long time since I’ve used it. We haven’t explored Javascript yet in Web 2. A search online yielded a date script that I can use, but highlighting the dates within the table is difficult.
            </p>

            <p><h1>Week 6</h1>
            Slightly more scrums taking place. I completed my task on my branch. We had a small rush to help a team member complete their task. I don't think it's enough for a scrum to just happen, we need to convey to each other if we are struggling. A scrum isn't a box to be ticked but instead a moment to share and listen to each other. The task didn't end up getting completed.
            </p>

            <p><h2>Week 7</h2>
            Sprint 3 consists of 1 issue, and that is Laravel. Before the first Laravel class I made myself familiar with Laravel and MVC. In Martins explaination I recognized most of the terms he was using. After the class I had a little bit more knowledge on Laravel, but not enough to feel confident in using it. Some members of the team didn't show up for that class. I should have done even more independant study of the software between classes, but ended up mostly winging it for the Thursday class. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn't mind taking the lead on Thursday since I though I had a stronger knowledge on Laravel than the other team members, but ultimately I took our repo down the wrong road and wasted a class. I don't think we would have been any further ahead though if someone else had sat at the keyboard rather than myself.
