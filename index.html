        <h3>Professional Proficiency</h3>
        <button class="collapsible">Communication</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="quote">“The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”</p><br>
          <p>Effective communication within a team allows for a greater transfer of knowledge between team mates. Working together towards a common goal is far easier when everyone is on the same page and is aware what others are doing. Honesty is essential, you want your team to know what it is really happening in your development.</p>

          <p>In Team Cat I maintained honesty throughout whether I was succeeding or struggling. If I kept quiet about my struggles, I would be doing myself and my team a disservice. We communicated often informally using Facebook Messenger, this was useful when people were away from class and I needed to get a message to them.</p>

          <p> In person communication was few and far between though. Class time was my main avenue of in person communication where the team would have brief scrums and then continue with work. Outside of Software Engineering class time is when I struggled the most with scrums. I understand the benefits of in person communication though, there is more information that can be conveyed when you include non-verbal communication. I could see when my team was unsure about an issue, so I could lead on with help or guidance.</p>

          <p>In future I would advocate for and attend scrums more diligently. When scrums did occur I was able to gain a greater understanding of the direction our team was heading, and could take measures to aid and guide others.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">Leadership</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p class="quote">“Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”</p>

            <p>A person displaying leadership will motivate, guide, and maintain a positive working environment. In Team Cat I think we all showed some form of leadership, there wasn’t one consistent leader figure. </p>

            <p>During this project I confused leadership with doing work like migrating to Laravel and deploying the website to a server. I realise now that the leadership qualities I displayed there was instead taking control of the situation and taking initiative by doing these tasks for the team. Being then elected for such tasks by others in future tells me that they appreciate me taking the lead and believe I am capable of leading.</p>

            <p>There were moments where my team was showing the opposite of leadership qualities, and instead degrading others. This would have been an opportune time to step in and make things right. I failed in this respect and deeply regret it.</p>

            <p>In future I would encourage my team mates more than I did. This was the form of leadership I lacked. There were certainly people who stepped up to fill that role, but there doesn’t just have to be one leader, or one person showing leader like qualities. I was all too content to finish my own task and then idly help in class, but I could have offered more help outside of class and given my free time to aid others.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Team Work</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p class="quote">“Working software is the primary measure of progress.”</p>

            <p>Working with several people on one piece of software requires team work. Without cooperation the pieces of code will not come together to make working software. Therefore, interpersonal skills and understanding is required to achieve success in software engineering.</p>

            <p>Before team work happened, Team Cat went through the process of forming, norming, storming and performing. Two members of the team I was already friends with, the other two members I only had passing knowledge of. In a real-world situation, I may know none of the people I am about to spend time working with on a project. </p>

            <p>When it came to doing work in a team during crunch times, I was always present and offering my help. It was a strong point for Team Cat on a Thursday afternoon where we all made the effort to come in and work on the project together. This was a trend that showed itself later in the development, as we discovered we could really depend on each other. </p>

            <p>After a few weeks we found our places in the team. We self-organized. I personally has a stronger grasp of Laravel and was able to give some insight to my team about how it works, a couple of people even missed the Laravel class, which I filled them in on. I tried up to speed on our requirements when possible and feed out information. We had some strong coders in the team, some strong leaders, and designers. This made for a robust team that was able to work together.</p>

            <p>I was satisfied with my contributions to the team but would like to encourage similar contribution from other team members in future. Also, being a team means we should all be on the same side, which wasn’t always the case. Conflicts sometimes can’t be helped, but part of being a team is resolving these issues and moving forward with the task at hand which was sometimes difficult.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Time Management</button>
        <div class="content">
                <p class="quote">“Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.”</p>

                <p>Time is in my opinion the biggest aspect of Agile software development. Every facet of Agile is based on time. Time scales, weighted issues, velocity, sprint, scrum, the list goes on. The first thing I remember about taking in the new idea of Agile is that it would be an increased work load that I’ve seen before, and that more time would be required. </p>

                <p>For the first Sprint two weeks felt like forever. My task was simple and didn’t require the entire Sprint duration. With the introduction of Laravel the work load went up significantly depending on the issue at hand. This is when time management became a factor. </p>

                <p>Over the course of the project I missed only one of my Sprint deadlines, I underestimated the difficulty of my task. For the next Sprint I retained this task as I was determined to finish it, and began working much sooner in the week in order to finish it. Time management has never been a strong point of mine, I often leave things to the very last minute, and time and time again I regret it when it comes to the crunch.</p>

                <p>When I am being held accountable for the work I have done or have not done it makes me more motivated to start my work earlier and be more prepared. When Sprints are set to a certain time frame and velocity, it gives ample room for preparation and thought as to how to efficiently manage my time. </p>

                <p>Completing tasks on time also effects the customer, where they are expecting incremental and useful updates to the software often. If I had more contact with the customer, I would have been more reluctant to leave work until the last minute, again being held accountable motivates and encourages progress. This is something I would need to improve on in a real-world situation if I ever wanted to be paid for my work.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Motivating Self and Others</button>
        <div class="content">
                <p class="quote">“Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”</p>

                <p>Everyone has off days. Sometimes it’s difficult to self-motivate. Having others to help you pick yourself up and get some work done is a benefit to working in a team. The issue may not even be work related so having some interpersonal skills to help deal with that is important. </p>

                <p>I have had times where it is difficult to focus my mind and get work done on an issue but having someone else nearby who is doing their work and I can talk to has helped. Left to my own devices I could waste an entire day, keeping open the channels of communication allowed for others to keep track of me and push me in the right direction. </p>

                <p>When it comes to helping motivate another team member, I think I fell short. Having seen how helpful some people are in our team I know I could have done much more. This can have a direct impact on work being done if there is no motivation within the group.</p>

        <h3>Technical Proficiency</h3>
        <button class="collapsible">Learning a new technology on your own.</button>
        <div class="content">
                <p>Prior to the Semester Tracker project, I had no experience with MAMP, Composer, or Laravel. I was in the first class where we created the Task List, which didn’t go in depth about models, views or controllers. I’ve since watched part way through a series on Lynda covering some of the basics and made use of all three parts of MVC in the Semester Tracker application.</p>

                <p>While I have successfully used some tools provided by Laravel, I still don’t think I gave it the respect it deserved, and I’ve felt this way since half way through the project. Laravel is a useful tool to use in conjunction with raw PHP, but I relied very heavily on my PHP knowledge rather than using the Laravel methods. </p>

                <p>My first failed Sprint issue was the “Edit a Semester” issue. In theory I just had to add an edit button and retrieve some information from the database, change it, and insert it again. This was the first time I realised I needed a controller. I heard some groups didn’t use controllers and instead made everything in routes, which will work but isn’t using Laravel to it’s full potential. </p>

                <p>Having failed the first time, I tried again in the next Sprint and succeeded. I found some material online which helped, and I felt an immense amount of satisfaction when it worked. This led me to then follow the same steps to create an edit button for papers and assignments. It was one of those Sprints where things just needed to be done, and I knew I could do it, so I did. I tried to use one controller for all 3 use cases but was unable to, so three controllers now exist in the project for editing.</p>

                <p>Learning Laravel on my own was difficult. I felt like I was the only one trying to make Laravel work, while others just used straight PHP. I should have pushed Laravel harder, but I couldn’t force others to learn a framework whilst I learn it at the same time. I don’t think I used all the resources available to me and could have watched deeper in to the Lynda series. It felt easier sometimes to slip in to using PHP because I took Web 2 Programming alongside Software Engineering, where PHP was actively being taught to me. Self-guided learning requires a lot of self-motivation to seek out answers across the internet or scour videos for relevant information. </p>

        <button class="collapsible">Implementing a program design that furthers the project.</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I didn’t implement much in the way of program design. Design was often a retrospective act, where the best-looking page design was duplicated across many. Blue was a colour that I didn’t decide on, but I don’t think any of us did. Functionality was at the forefront of minds most of the time.</p>

            <p>The emphasis on working software pushed design to the wayside, but in a bigger team there would be active issues regarding design. I enjoy design and could spend days discussing and brainstorming on ways to improve the user experience. Once the initial design was decided on it never came back in to consideration. Near the end of our last sprint I made several of the pages share a common design which looked more professional, I should have consulted my team about the decision though.</p>
                
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Deploying or installing dependencies, libraries or other technologies in to your project.</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Beyond the initial deployment and Composer update of dependencies I didn’t consider involving other libraries or technologies. Laravel was the first big hurdle that I have not yet mastered, so involving more new software would have been a bad idea.</p>
               
            <p>The only additional resource involved was the W3 Schools CSS framework that we all had some previous experience with. Subtle yet nice to look at stylesheet which can be easily inserted in to existing code. Without it we would have been hand coding CSS which is time consuming, so in the interest of maximising the amount of work not done, we used the pre-existing stylesheet.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Providing significant systems administration services for your project.</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Systems administration lay mostly with deployment to the server, modifications to the .env file, and future pulls to the server. This was handled by me and overseen by the team. During the first session where deployment was brought up, I configured the account that would be used to interact with the server. I have experience with Linux and was navigating around the server, and used VIM to modify the .env file, this was the incorrect thing to do and caused some trouble with pushing and pulling. That was a misstep that had to be corrected by Martin and a lesson was learned. Future instances of interaction with the server went far more smoothly, and I learned that I should only be pulling updated code to the server and never modifying server files.</p>
               
            <p>Systems administration is a career I would like to pursue, and I am signed up for the course of the same name next year. I would like to know what it’s like outside of development team and just working with a system.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Building or configuring hardware that is central to the functioning of your project.</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Thankfully the server was configured for us. It may have been outside of scope for the project, but system administration for a project like this could require greater control over a server to the point of configuring ourselves.</p>
               
            <p>Configuring hardware can give a greater understanding of the inner operation and how our website interacts with the world. There will be a great deal of security involved, and if our site were to be available to world there is always the possibility of malicious attacks.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Advanced use and leadership of source code control.</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Another form of systems administration was with Github. While there is still much I don’t know about Github, I have learned how to roll back pushes in the case of a potentially ruined project. I have helped solve several merge conflicts with my team, made pull requests and completed pull requests. Wrestling with Github has been a worthwhile experience where the stakes aren’t outrageously high, because a mistake made on a project where bigger things are on the line could be job ending. </p>

            <p>Knowing what I know now I would have implemented a better naming system for branches, and overseen other branches to a greater degree. I know that Github reflects that some branches never made it back to the master branch, and that was handled poorly in the beginning. In a large project with many branches there would need to be strict regulations in place to maintain order.</p>
