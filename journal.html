    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Forming and norming. We came together as a group of four, with the addition of a fifth member shortly after. Some members of the group I have worked with before and others I haven’t, so norming had to take place. We aren’t aware of the strengths and weaknesses within the team yet but were able to assign tasks quickly.

    <button class="collapsible">Week 3</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The session on Github management was useful and team strengthening. Between Software Engineering and Linux I’ve found enjoyment in the command line, I’m trying to use it where possible. I know I can move documents in the cloned repo with a mouse click, I chose to move them with the command line instead. A strong handle on the Github platform makes life easier. 
            Some storming occurred between another teammate and I. It was embarrassing to have happen in front of other teams, I now know I need to be more understanding of my teammates. To be motivated to work together in a team there needs to be a level of professionalism and acceptance of ideas, I took this on board.
            The website pages are working nicely together, and we have it hosted up on Github pages. Github pages took some figuring out, but a teammate and I managed to get it working. Jekyll is another story, but for now the website works and most user stories have been fulfilled.

    <button class="collapsible">Week 4</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Scrums are a sticking point for the team. I myself have 2 days during the week without classes, so I’m only able to be present for 3 scrums a week (if they happen). A scrum schedule was made up during the second week but it has been difficult to adhere to. Most scrums happen for us in the classroom.
        I reviewed a teammates web page and moved it to the reviewer approved column. My task for the sprint has also been moved to this column, it’s reassuring  to know that a teammate has seen it and is happy with my work.
        Speaking with the client this week let us know that we are on the right track. I was worried about the look of our website, but that is a matter for a future sprint goal. We have working software which is more important. 
        Agile development makes me see the importance in the little things. Many small steps can lead to a great piece of software. Each step of development is deliberate, but not permanent. </p>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 5</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sprint 2 planning and task assigning on Tuesday. We successfully closed 4 out of 5 of our issues from the previous Sprint, with one issues rolling over to the second Sprint. 
        During reflection I realized that I had not been attending as many Scrums as I should be, and we weren’t enforcing them well enough as a team. I attended all Scrums possible for the rest of the week.
        Git Branches were introduced. I asked many questions so I could be completely clear on how  they work and why we need them. I created my own branch for my Sprint 2 issue but have not yet pushed to the master branch. I would like to discuss with my team before this happens.
        I’m having a difficult time incorporating Javascript in to the html, it has been a long time since I’ve used it. We haven’t explored Javascript yet in Web 2. A search online yielded a date script that I can use, but highlighting the dates within the table is difficult.</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 6</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Slightly more scrums taking place. I completed my task on my branch. We had a small rush to help a team member complete their task. I don't think it's enough for a scrum to just happen, we need to convey to each other if we are struggling. A scrum isn't a box to be ticked but instead a moment to share and listen to each other. The task didn't end up getting completed.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 7</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sprint 3 consists of 1 issue, and that is Laravel. Before the first Laravel class I made myself familiar with Laravel and MVC. In Martins explaination I recognized most of the terms he was using. After the class I had a little bit more knowledge on Laravel, but not enough to feel confident in using it. Some members of the team didn't show up for that class. I should have done even more independant study of the software between classes, but ended up mostly winging it for the Thursday class.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 8</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I learned how to roll back changes in Github, this was to solve the issue of having Laravel incorrectly integrated with our website. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 9</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sprint 4 involves many new issues presented by the clients. These issues are unique to Laravel. We deployed the website to a remote server. Some files were changed incorrectly requiring more rolling back. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 10</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Another Thursday push to fix up some unfinished issues. I came to terms with the fact that I was not familiar enough with Laravel to complete my task.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 11</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I learned how to deploy a SSH key for Github, to avoid repetitive login entries. I applied this knowledge again at home for the same purpose. I've been reassigned my previous task that wasn't finished for Sprint 5, this time I will make a greater effort to learn the nuances of Laravel.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 12</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Using online resources I was able to create an edit button for each semester. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 13</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sprint 6 consists of adding in minor functionality that were certain we can create. Several other issues have been completed that took a long time to complete. We have a mostly functioning website now. For this sprint I will be implementing the edit button for assignments and papers, considering I now have the knowledge to do so.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 14</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I would have liked to create one controller for all three edit buttons, but it proved difficult with naming conventions. These are the only controllers that exist in our project, I feel like we should have used controllers more. We haven't used the the idea of MVC to it's fullest. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Week 15</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Present website to Elise, Martin, Joy and Vaughn. Everyone spoke about a certain part of the website they were involved. I'm pleased that the website worked as we expected.</p>
