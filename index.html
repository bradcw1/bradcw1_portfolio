            Forming and norming. We came together as a group of four, with the addition of a fifth member shortly after. Some members of the group I have worked with before and others I haven’t, so norming had to take place. We aren’t aware of the strengths and weaknesses within the team yet but were able to assign tasks quickly.

            The session on Github management was useful and team strengthening. Between Software Engineering and Linux I’ve found enjoyment in the command line, I’m trying to use it where possible. I know I can move documents in the cloned repo with a mouse click, I chose to move them with the command line instead. A strong handle on the Github platform makes life easier. 
            Some storming occurred between another teammate and I. It was embarrassing to have happen in front of other teams, I now know I need to be more understanding of my teammates. To be motivated to work together in a team there needs to be a level of professionalism and acceptance of ideas, I took this on board.
            The website pages are working nicely together, and we have it hosted up on Github pages. Github pages took some figuring out, but a teammate and I managed to get it working. Jekyll is another story, but for now the website works and most user stories have been fulfilled.

        <p><h1>Week 4</h1><br>
Scrums are a sticking point for the team. I myself have 2 days during the week without classes, so I’m only able to be present for 3 scrums a week (if they happen). A scrum schedule was made up during the second week but it has been difficult to adhere to. Most scrums happen for us in the classroom.
I reviewed a teammates web page and moved it to the reviewer approved column. My task for the sprint has also been moved to this column, it’s reassuring  to know that a teammate has seen it and is happy with my work.
Speaking with the client this week let us know that we are on the right track. I was worried about the look of our website, but that is a matter for a future sprint goal. We have working software which is more important. 
Agile development makes me see the importance in the little things. Many small steps can lead to a great piece of software. Each step of development is deliberate, but not permanent.

        <p><h1>Week 5</h1>
            Sprint 2 planning and task assigning on Tuesday. We successfully closed 4 out of 5 of our issues from the previous Sprint, with one issues rolling over to the second Sprint. 
During reflection I realized that I had not been attending as many Scrums as I should be, and we weren’t enforcing them well enough as a team. I attended all Scrums possible for the rest of the week.
Git Branches were introduced. I asked many questions so I could be completely clear on how  they work and why we need them. I created my own branch for my Sprint 2 issue but have not yet pushed to the master branch. I would like to discuss with my team before this happens.
I’m having a difficult time incorporating Javascript in to the html, it has been a long time since I’ve used it. We haven’t explored Javascript yet in Web 2. A search online yielded a date script that I can use, but highlighting the dates within the table is difficult.
