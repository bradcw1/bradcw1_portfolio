        <p>Week 2
            Forming and norming. We came together as a group of four, with the addition of a fifth member shortly after. Some members of the group I have worked with before and others I haven’t, so norming had to take place. We aren’t aware of the strengths and weaknesses within the team yet but were able to assign tasks quickly.

        <p>Week 3
            The session on Github management was useful and team strengthening. Between Software Engineering and Linux I’ve found enjoyment in the command line, I’m trying to use it where possible. I know I can move documents in the cloned repo with a mouse click, I chose to move them with the command line instead. A strong handle on the Github platform makes life easier. 
            Some storming occurred between another teammate and I. It was embarrassing to have happen in front of other teams, I now know I need to be more understanding of my teammates. To be motivated to work together in a team there needs to be a level of professionalism and acceptance of ideas, I took this on board.
            The website pages are working nicely together, and we have it hosted up on Github pages. Github pages took some figuring out, but a teammate and I managed to get it working. Jekyll is another story, but for now the website works and most user stories have been fulfilled.

            Week 4
Scrums are a sticking point for the team. I myself have 2 days during the week without classes, so I’m only able to be present for 3 scrums a week (if they happen). A scrum schedule was made up during the second week but it has been difficult to adhere to. Most scrums happen for us in the classroom.
I reviewed a teammates web page and moved it to the reviewer approved column. My task for the sprint has also been moved to this column, it’s reassuring  to know that a teammate has seen it and is happy with my work.
Speaking with the client this week let us know that we are on the right track. I was worried about the look of our website, but that is a matter for a future sprint goal. We have working software which is more important. 
Agile development makes me see the importance in the little things. Many small steps can lead to a great piece of software. Each step of development is deliberate, but not permanent.
